# Linked-List-Visualizer
The Linked List Visualizer is a Java-based tool that visually demonstrates how linked lists work. It allows users to insert, delete, and search nodes with real-time animations. Built using Java Swing/JavaFX, it clearly shows node connections and pointer movement. The project helps students understand data structures and memory linking easily.
